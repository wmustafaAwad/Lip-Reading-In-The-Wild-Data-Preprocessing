# Lip-Reading-In-The-Wild-Data-Preprocessing
Data Preprocessing for Oxford's LRW Youtube Dataset

This project was done as part of the final project for the **CIE 555: Neural Networks and Deep Learning Course** at Zewail City, taught by Dr. Mohammed Elshennawy. <br>

The notebook contains fully automated video preprocessing for the dataset from OXFORD Visual Geometry Group's dataset ([LRW: Lip Reading in the Wild](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/lip_reading/lrw1.html)) by BBC.  <br>

This is not by any means an official implementation.<br>


The preprocessing was done using ffmpeg, youtube-dl, and Python.

# IMPORTANT NOTE:
The notebook assumes running in a google colab environment. If not, please remove the first part (mounting drive, and unzipping) and edit the following code accordingly.
